App.js imports all the components in the components folder. useContext is in the component AuthContext.js which is wrapped around a component in App called AppContent. AuthContext is used to authenticate an account and ensures the user is signed in. It shares the value around App.js with user, signInWithGoogle, and signOutUser. Within AuthContext, the component Auth is used call user, signInWithGoogle, and signOutUser. Another useContext is used in App.js wrapped inside AuthContext to handle the Contacts. This useContext shares the useReducer info and shares state, addContact, updateContact, and deleteContact to AppContent component in App.js, which is the main page of my App.

How the App run, if you are not signed in, return a login screen with a title and a button to sign. If you are a user, return the title, log out button, and contact form for submit. ContactForm passed the currentContact and a function (handleSaveContact) to its component. currentContact is a useState not sharing with useContext and handleSaveContact is an function to update or add contacts which is passing data through the useContext component name useContacts.

ContactList component retrieves data from the App.js setCurrentContact useState to edit the contact. on ContactList form, useContext is passed down by useContacts for deleting the contact
